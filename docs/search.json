They are a valuable resource for students who may have questions, are seeking guidance, or discussion & community.\nCourse Collaboration Leaders (CCLs) are typically undergraduate students who have experience with DSA courses (e.g., have taken at least one DSA course).\n\nCCL office hours are in-person and on Zoom.\nThe CCL office hours schedule is made available each semester and instructors should provide this information to students in their courses with additional reminders on a weekly basis.\n\nThe current semester CCL schedule will be given to you so that you can advertise this resource in your courses and on your course pages. Please notify the Teaching Coordinator if you have students from your courses that you want to recommend to become a Course Collaboration Leader in a future semester or year.\nPlease forward other inquiries from students wanting to contribute to the DSA to datascienceacademy@ncsu.edu.\nAdditional information about graduate student TA inquiries",

    "text": "2.1 The ADAPT Model: Background\nThe All-Campus through Accessible Project-based Teaching & Learning (ADAPT course model) consists of three primary components:\nEach DSC course involves a project, or mini-projects, as a framework for students to apply and demonstrate their learning in an application-focused context.\nStudents may choose courses of study and subsequent career paths, in part, due to how they experience a given field or learning environment. A goal of the DSA - through DSA courses - is that students take DSA courses and have opportunities to be agents in their learning. This aspect of the course model can be realized through providing students with opportunities to engage in relevant choices and decisions that directly and positively impact their DSA course process. Through a focus on learner agency, students will not only learn content-specific skills but will also move towards having the means to facilitate their own learning beyond the course. Thus, we seek to connect our course structures to students’ backgrounds and interests to the data science and AI landscape.\nData science is an interdisciplinary field. The 10 common learning elements are overarching objectives that can be considered across courses as a means to broaden students experiences with a given course topic.",

    "section": "2.2 Classroom Considerations",
    "text": "2.2 Classroom Considerations\nEach of our courses are 1 credit. University Contact/Credit Hour Guidelines set the expectation that this amounts to approximately 3 hours of student time per week (e.g., 50 minute class, two hours outside of class).\n\nPlease keep the expected time guidelines in mind when designing your course and related activities. In addition, please use student feedback to adjust accordingly.\n\n\n2.2.1 Implementation\nA challenge that can arise in the DSA course teaching process involves how to go about effectively relaying the information that you want students to receive as you consider the course structure and time limitations.\nThese constraints make for interesting design challenges and many creative courses experiences follow.\nA Few Guidelines\nAs a guide, one method to address the course implementation structure is to consider developing your essential concepts based on the desired project outcomes. Consider the following:\n\nPlanning your instruction based on the question “What are the few and essential points students need to know to accomplish this step in the project?”. This may serve as the contents of a given lecture within the project-based focus.\nBuilding your course assignments as components of the project can allow students to create their products over time (as projects typically occur in real world settings) and can keep course workloads consistent. Furthermore, the project outcomes and goals can motivate the learning outcomes and the related assignments, and grounds them in application-focused contexts. Projects built over time can culminate with student presentations, reports, and the like.\nAnother framework to consider for planning your course delivery is the Launch (20 minutes) -&gt; Explore (20 minutes) -&gt; Discuss (10 minutes) framework, where the key concepts are presented within 20 or so minutes of the “launch”, and time is allotted for students to actively participate through practice/development and discussion within a class, or with significant frequency (Explore & Discuss). These time frames are a just a reference point and if implemented will naturally vary from class to class.\n\nExample: (50 minute class - launch, discuss, explore) Project Step 1 - Key Concepts -&gt; Weekly Key Concepts Discussions -&gt; In class work and getting started on Project Step 1/assignment 1.\n\n\nAdditional Considerations\nAs you develop your course, consider how you will assess the students’ projects.\n\nIn determining this criteria, it is helpful to clearly present the assessment criteria to students. For example, you may have a rubric on which project assessments are based, and you can share this with the students in advance so that the project expectations are clear. Developed assessment criteria can also serve as a project building guide.\n\nBalancing grading time and data science project work can be a challenge. Consider how you might be able to incorporate structured and unstructured learning/feedback opportunities for students.\n\nExample: As you present your key lesson concepts, you may incorporate student questions that have an auto-grading feature (structured). Subsequently, you may allow them to practice similar concepts on their own datasets as a component of their project work (unstructured).\n\nFeedback from Educational Research\nDr. Sunghwan Byun and Dr. Jeanne McClure offer additional suggestions here: Educational Research at the Data Science Academy - Insights from 2022-2023. This document contains information on what may work well and what my require more attention within the DSA course instructional process based on certain aspects of student feedback.",

We will discuss topics of interest, which may include the ADAPT model, and also provide opportunities for lesson presentations and reviews, among other possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\n\n\nAttend 2 instructor meetings per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Instructor Chat Group\nYou will be added to a chat group through your NCSU credentials - DSA Instructors Group - Spring 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\n\n\nMonitor information in the group chat space.\n\n\n\n\nUpdates and reminders will be posted to this space.\nGeneral questions and instructor communication may occur in this space.\n\nWe appreciate acknowledgement of receipt with a “thumbs up”, or otherwise, particularly for reminders.\n\n\n3.1.3 Student Work Collection\nAs part of the DSA mission to provide appropriate learning opportunities at various levels (including within a given course), we collect data to assess our offerings and learning approach. The purpose of the data collection is to evaluate the DSA and how well we are serving our students so that informed adjustments and improvements can be made. In addition we plan to share what we learn with other universities and researchers. For this process, students will be asked for their consent to data collection/research participation at the beginning of the course in terms of the use of their de-identified data and the related work of the DSA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\n\n\nPlan to collect your students’ work for each assignment and project.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: To facilitate student work collection, please use the following naming conventions, course_section_semester_assignment_unityID, where course is the 3 digit prefix and number, section is the three digit section number, semester is FA (Fall) or SP (Spring) followed by the last two digits of the year, A is for assignments and FP is for final project. The unityID is for the student whose work is being collected - each student has a unique unityID. Examples below. Note: If students turn in group assignments, adjustments may be needed.\n\nDSA201_001_FA24_A1_djstokes\nDSA495_601_SP25_FP_unityID\nDSA412_011_FA25_A5_unityID\n\nNOTE: Build this into your assignment collection protocol so that the process in not an extra burden for you (i.e., require students to submit each of their assignments named in the way presented in the naming conventions).\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Student Feedback Questionnaires\nThree times throughout the semester, we will provide course questionnaires, via survey link, for you to give to your students. These questionnaires are designed to provide you with insight into students’ perspectives of your course and as a source of course evaluation. For these questionnaires, please note the following:\n\nProvide 5 minutes of class-time for students to complete the questionnaires.\nEncourage and incentivize participation (e.g., count as a grade, or extra credit),\nStudent feedback will be de-identified and shared back with you,\nYou can request completion information for grading/extra-credit purposes,\nThere is an 80% completion expectation & goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\n\n\nProvide 5 minutes of class time for students to complete the course questionnaires.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Course Collaboration Leaders Support\nCourse Collaboration Leaders Support & More\nThis document includes Course Collaboration Leaders (CCLs) peer-support office hours, as well as other recommendations for student support. The CCLs are typically available on a daily basis, based on the schedule provided. They offer support to their peers in online and in person spaces noted on the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\n\n\nProvide the Course Collaboration Leaders Support & More information to your students.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Build this reminder into your weekly routine so that students are continuously made aware of this resource and the CCLs office hours, in particular.\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Course Attendance & Mid-term Assessments\n\nTracking attendance is required for all 200 level courses (see REG 02.20.03 - Attendance Regulations). This is also a good practice for courses in general so that you can identify any students who may need extra communication or support (e.g., Student Progress Reports).\n\nFor online courses: How To Retrieve Meeting Attendance on Zoom (from Dr. Jamie Harr).\n\nPlease communicate to students why attendance is important. For example, collaboration and discussion are expectations for data scientists and individuals working within related fields/titles. These aspect may be an integral part of your course as well, so students should know that this is an expectation and should plan to attend with the intent to participate in discussions and collaborations.\nFor online courses, it may be useful to establish classroom expectations that students keep their cameras on, whenever possible, as part of the course engagement process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\n\n\nCommunicate expectations to students that may include classroom norms, attendance, and participation guidelines.\n\n\n\nThe mid-term is a good time to consider the need for Academic Progress Reports. However, you may submit these reports sooner or later depending on need.\n\n\n3.1.7 Instructor Communication\nAs an instructor, you are expected to notify the Teaching Coordinator of attendance conflicts. This includes:\n\nConflicts with scheduled classes,\nConflicts with instructor discussions,\nIssues with other deadlines, such as questionnaire timelines.\n\nNote that instructor discussion attendance is part of your responsibility as an instructor in the DSA.\nLearning Technologies support can be sought through DELTA. However, you are encouraged to post questions to the instructor group chat space where others may be able to help you sooner and/or may have the same or similar questions. Email is fine too.",
