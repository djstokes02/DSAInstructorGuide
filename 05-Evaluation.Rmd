# Optional Instructional Feedback

Feedback on student reflections will be given to you at least for parts 1 and 2 of 3. Beyond this standar, optional instruction observations, meetings, and/or additional feedback can be scheduled throughout the semester. Formats include:

 - Scheduling a pre-observation discussion, observation, and post-obeservation discussion.
 - Scheduling the pre and post observations around student survey/reflection feedback.
 - Scheduling a single observation with feedback.
 - Combinations of the above, or other ideas of interest.
 
 As you consider these options, please note the timelines for when the observations may work best (e.g., as indicated in the weekly information in Section 3).
