### Course Collaboration Leaders Support.

**A peer support resource for students in DSC courses**

Course Collaboration Leaders (CCLs) are typically undergraduate students who have experience with DSC courses (e.g., have taken at least one DSC course). 

 - Throughout the semester the CCLs offer office hours (in-person and on Zoom). Instructors may refer students in their classes to the CCLs to get peer support, find a space for questions and discussion, or simply a place to do their work. 
 - The CCL office hours schedule is made available each semester and instructors should provide this information to students in their courses and additional reminders on a regular basis.

For future semesters, please notify the Teaching Coordinator about any student(s) from your course(s) that you want to recommend to become a Course Collaboration Leader.
