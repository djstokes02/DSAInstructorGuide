### Course Collaboration Leaders

Course Collaboration Leaders (CCLs) are typically undergraduate students who have experience with DSC courses (e.g., have taken at least one DSC course). The CCLs are a great resource for supporting students in DSC courses. 

Throughout the semester the CCLs offer office hours (in-person and on Zoom) where instructors may refer students who may be interested in peer support, a forum for questions and discussion, or a place to do their work. The CCL office hours schedule is made available each semester and instructors should provide this information to students in their courses with reminders on a regular basis.
