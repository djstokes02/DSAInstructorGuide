### Course Collaboration Leaders Support.

**What and who are the DSA course collaboration leaders**?

The DSA Course Collaboration Leaders (CCLs) support DSA teaching and learning by offering office hours to their peers in DSA courses. They are a valuable resource for students who may have questions, are seeking guidance, or discussion & community.

Course Collaboration Leaders (CCLs) are typically undergraduate students who have experience with DSA courses (e.g., have taken at least one DSA course). 

 - CCL office hours are in-person and on Zoom. 
 - The CCL office hours schedule is made available each semester and instructors should provide this information to students in their courses with additional reminders on a weekly basis.

The current semester CCL schedule will be given to you so that you can advertise this resource in your courses and on your course pages. Please notify the Teaching Coordinator if you have students from your courses that you want to recommend to become a Course Collaboration Leader in a future semester or year.

Please forward other inquiries from students wanting to contribute to the DSA to datascienceacademy@ncsu.edu.
