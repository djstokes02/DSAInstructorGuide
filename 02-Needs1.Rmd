# What Do I Need to Do (All Semester)?

## Throughout the Semester

### Bi-monthly Teacher Meetings

Throughout the semester we will have weekly instructor meetings designed to build community through discussion and support around the DSA course teaching experience. From time to time, we my provide information and discussion topics about pedagogical considerations with respect to the ADAPT model and course format. 
 
 <span style="color: #CC0000;"> *Please plan to attend 2 instructor meetings per month.* </span>

### Instructor Chat Group

You will be added to a chat group through your NCSU credentials. 

 <span style="color: #CC0000;"> *Please plan to monitor information posted in this space.* </span>
 
 - Events and opportunities may be posted to this space.
 - Reminders may be posted to this space.
 - General questions and instructor communication may occur in this space.

We appreciate acknowledgement of receipt with a "thumbs up", or otherwise, particularly for reminders.
 
### Student Work Collection

As part of the DSA mission to provide appropriate courses at various levels (including within a given course), we collect data to assess our offerings and learning approach. The purpose of the data collection is to evaluate the DSA and how well we are serving our students so that adjustments can be made accordingly for continuous improvement. In addition we plan to share what we learn with other universities and researchers. Students will be asked for their consent to data collection/research participation at the beginning of the course with respect to the use of their de-identified data and the related work of the DSA.

<span style="color: #CC0000;"> *Please plan to collect your students' work for each assignment and the project(s)*. </span>

 - NOTE: To facilitate student work collection, please use the following `naming conventions`, `course_section_semester_assignment_unityID`, where course is the 3 digit prefix and number, section is the three digit section number, semester in FA (Fall) or SP (Spring) followed by last two digits of the year, A is for assignments and FP is for final project. The unityID is for the student whose work is being collected. Examples below.
 
  `DSC295_001_FA23_A1_djstokes`
  
  `DSC495_601_SP24_FP_unityID`
  
  `DSC201_011_FA23_A5_djstokes`

### Student Course Reflections

Three times throughout the semester, we will provide course reflections, via survey link, for you to give to your students. These survey/questionnaires are designed to provide you with insight into students' perspectives of your course so that you can utilize the information to improve processes. With respect to these reflection, please note the following below:
 
 - Encourage and incentivize participation (e.g., count as a grade, or extra credit),
 - There is an 80% completion expectation & goal,
 - Student feedback will be de-identified and shared back with you,
 - You can request completion information for grading/extra-credit purposes.

<span style="color: #CC0000;"> *Please plan to provide class time for students to complete the course reflections*. </span>

 - NOTE: Build this into your assignment collection protocol so that the process in not an extra burden for you (e.g., require students to submit each of their assignments named in the way presented in the naming conventions).

### 6 Ways to Get Help
 
This document is created to provide support to students. Part of this support includes Course Collaboration Leaders (CCLs) office/peer-support hours. The CCLs are typically available on a daily basis according to the provided schedule. They offer support to their peers in online and in person spaces. 
 
<span style="color: #CC0000;"> *Please plan to provide the 6 Ways to Get Help information to your students*. </span> 
 
 - NOTE: Build this reminder into your weekly routine so that students are continuously made aware of this resource.
 
### Attendance & Mid-term Assessments

Tracking attendance is required for all 200 level courses (see [REG 02.20.03 - Attendance Regulations](https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03-attendance-regulations/)). This is also a good practice for courses in general so that you can identify any students who may need extra communication or support (e.g., Student Progress Reports). 
 
 - Please communicate to students why attendance is important. For example, collaboration and discussion are expectations for data scientists and individuals working within related fields/titles. These aspect may be an integral part of your course as well, so students should know this is an expectation and should plan to attend with the intent to participate in discussions and collaborations.
 
 - For online courses, it may be useful to establish classroom expectations that students keep their cameras on, whenever possible, as part of the course engagement process.

<span style="color: #CC0000;"> *Please plan to facilitate student success through communicated expectations*. </span> 

The mid-term is a good time to consider the need for [Academic Progress Reports](https://dasa.ncsu.edu/faculty-resources/academic-progress-reporting/). However, you may submit these reports sooner or later depending on need.
